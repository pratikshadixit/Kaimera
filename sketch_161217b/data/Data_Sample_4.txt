(We can get a whole bunch of other stuff regarding texts, like metadata (who they were sent to and when), which is what the NSA collects, or phone metadata, for example. The only concern with that is that it doxes people a bit, which we obviously want to avoid. Getting the bodies of the text messages may be more intrusive, but at least it's completely anonymized.)
